<h1>Information Systems &amp; Technology FAQs </h1>

<div id="header">
<p>The IS&amp;T Department is in the process of developing a comprehensive list of frequently 
asked questions and answers for our students.   If you don't see an answer to your question 
below please email your question to the IS&amp;T <a href="Mailto: anissa.buffington@ucas-edu.net"> Mail to: Anissa Buffington</a></p>

<h2>Question:</h2> <p class="minniemouse">How is IS/IT different from Computer Science?</p> 

<h2>Answer:</h2> <p>To be sure there is a degree of overlap between these disciplines. 
Both study computer <span class="minniemouse">hardware and software.</span> Computer Science studies in depth the internal 
operations of computers and the development of systems software to make computers easy to use.</p> 
<p>IS/IT, on the other hand, is concerned more with the users and business uses of computers than 
with the computers themselves. IS/IT requires a moderate-level of programming and a little 
hardware knowledge; however, its primary focus is on using the technology to meet business needs. </p>

<h2>Question:</h2> <p>How can I test out of a class for which I already know the content? </p>

<h2>Answer:</h2> <p>Follow this process:</p>

<ol><li>Go to the IS&amp;T Department office in CS 601 and visit with the IS&amp;T office administrator, Cheryl Levi, 
and ask her to complete the request for test out online form.</li>

<li>With the help of the office admin, arrange with the faculty member currently teaching the class to take the exam.</li> 


<li>Pay a $15 test out fee at the UVU Cashier window. </li>

<li>Take the exam.  Some exams may require more than one step in the test out process.</li>


<li>The instructor will notify you and the the office admininistrator if you have passed the exam.</li>   

<li>You will then visit with the office administrator again to decide if you want to buy the credits for the class.</li>  

<li>If you decide to pay for these credits you must pay $5 for each credit at the UVU cashier.</li>


<li>The office administrator will then complete your online test out form.</li></ol>
 


<h2>Question:</h2> <p>Why do I have to pay a lab fee for a class? What if I don't use the lab computers? </p>


<h2>Answer:</h2> <p>All fees go toward maintaining state-of-the-art hardware and software technology 
for your use while at school and for printing up to 200 pages from the lab computers. 
We have found that student's who request a refund of the fee soon wish that they hadn't, 
so please take advantage of this great service. There are no waiting lines to use the 
School of Technology and Computing.</p>

<h4>Student Testimonial:</h4>

<blockquote>"I have found it very helpful to clarify questions I have in the program before making decisions 
like deciding on what classes to take in what order.  I would hate to have made a bad guess and
spend an entire semester in a course I did not need to graduate.  If my advisor is not available,
I try to check these FAQs to see if the answer to my question is here." -- Jane Doe --</blockquote>
