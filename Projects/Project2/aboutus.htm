<h2 id="beginning">In the Beginning ...</h2>

<p>Utah Backyard Birds began with a bird lover who took way too many pictures. Bart 
Jones started out as a backyard bird watcher.</p> 

<p> He was an artist and photographer 
and birds were one of his favorite subjects. Many of the birds also captured in 
watercolors,<br /> usually with some tree or flowers in the background.</p> 

<p>Bart would set out many different kinds of feed to attract as many bird <br />varieties as possible. 
Soon his backyard in Eureka became an aviary and the expense of keeping all his 
feathered visitors fed was <br />impacting his pocketbook. </p>

<p>After developing hundreds of bird photos and creating about a hundred watercolors, 
Bart decided to see how he could translate <br />his passion for these feathered friends 
into a money making venture. He decided to try to create a calendar and associated 
<br />postcard book and sell them to those who would enjoy the local wildlife. </p>

<h2 id="where" >Where we are today...</h2>

<p>Utah Backyard Birds began as a company in 1997. Bart Jones compiled a wide 
variety of his best and most unique bird <br />photos into a calendar and postcard 
book series.</p> 

<p>His product line is available through this website and also can 
be found in Nature Lovers stores countrywide. Each month <br />of the calendar 
contains interesting information about the bird variety depicted for that month.</p> 

 
<p>Not only does Bart just capture these birds, but he has also researched their 
behaviors, migration patterns and is a reservoir <br />of information about local 
Utah birds. He felt that he could share this knowledge with others as well as 
his wonderful still <br />life photographs and artwork. </p>

<h2 id="going">Where We are Going ...</h2>
 
<p>While Utah Backyard Birds is still a young company, the artwork and photographic 
creations of Bart Jones have received <br />much adulation from art critics as well as 
the public. Many customers are repeat buyers year after year.</p> <p>Visitors to Utah 
can purchase the postcard books at local bookstores, the Salt Lake Airport and 
also at local grocery stores. <br />Bart Jones has big plans for the future of the 
company.</p> <p>He would soon like to branch out into sharing his images of insects and 
arachnids (spiders). Some of his macro-photography <br />is truly inspiring.</p>
