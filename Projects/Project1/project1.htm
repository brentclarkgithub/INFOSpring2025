<li>My first impression of this site was that it was nice and presentable. 
It looked like it was easy to navigate on.</li>

<li>This website has some links on the bottom, and left side of the home page. 
It also has some tabs at the top that you <br />can click on that will take you to 
different pages. Within the other pages, there are more links that you can click on.</li>

<li>The website structure makes sense to me because it is easy to know where 
everything is. I know that if I wanted <br />to look at some recipes, I could click 
on the recipes tab at the top. Most everything is clearly labeled.</li>

<li>I think that the graphics and layout on this website do not 
distract from the website itself. The colors and layout <br />are very pleasing to 
the eye.</li>

<li>It did not take the website long at all to load. It loaded very quickly. 
The website was loaded almost instantly.</li>

<li>The text was very easy to read because it was a good font size and the color 
was not too dark, and not too light. <br />The background was white so it did not 
distract from the website.</li>

<li>This site has a navigation bar. It is easy to use and was designed well.</li>

<li>The color scheme of this website is red, blue, and black.</li>

<li>When put into a smaller window, the website still has most all the 
information on it. However, it does not have the <br />navigation bar when 
in a smaller window.</li>

<li>This site is for a grocery store, but it has a page that has recipes on it. 
I thougt this was unusual for a grocery store <br />website because I haven't seen that
 on other store websites.</li>

<h4>Website 2 Critique</h4>

<li>My first impression of this site was that it seemed slightly boring at first.
I didn't quite know what it was. I only saw <br />the words in the middle of the home 
page and didn't see the navigation bar.</li>

<li>This site does not have any links anywhere on the page. The only links it has
 are the ones within the navigation bar.</li>
 
<li>The structure of this website confuses me a little bit. It confuses me 
because I don't really know where things are and <br />it is a little hard to 
understand the website in general.</li>

<li>I think that the layout and pictures distract from the website because that 
is really the only thing that I see. Until you <br />scroll down, you can't actually
 see the words, only the pictures.</li>
 
<li>The load time was very fast. I didn't have to wait long for it to load.</li>

<li>The text is not very readable on the top of each page. The text is white which
 makes it hard to read against the background. <br /> The background is a picture 
 on every page and I feel like it detracts form the website. I feel like all that
 you see is the picture.</li>

<li>This website has a navigation bar. It is hard to see because it blends in with 
 the background and it looks like any other <br />text on the page.</li>
 
<li>The whole website is black, gray, white, and purple. It has a darker theme.</li>

<li>This site responds very well to smaller window sizes. The navigation bar is 
still there. It is just condensed down to <br />three little lines in the corner. 
All of the text still fits on the page and you can still see the picture pretty well.</li>
 
<li>Something good that they did was make the background black as you scroll down
 so that you can actually read what <br />the text says.</li>

<h4>Website 3 Critique</h4>

<ol>

<li>My first impression of this website was that it looked very nice and easy to navigate on.</li>

<li>This website has links on the left side of the page. It also has some links
in the middle of the page.</li>

<li>The structure of this website makes sense to me because it is not very cluttered 
and it is very easy to look up <br />information.</li>

<li>The graphics and layout help the website because it is very pleasing to the eye. 
The graphics are simple but <br />still helpful to the website.</li>

<li>The load time was not very long for this website. It loaded pretty quickly.</li>

<li>The text was very easy to read and the background on each page helped the website
 because it gave you an <br />idea of what all these places look like. It helps to know 
 what the website is about as well.</li>
 
<li>This website has a navigation bar and it is very well done. It is easy to tell
 what all of the tabs lead to. It is <br />very easy to read and understand.</li>
 
<li>This site has black text with simple and easy to read fonts. There are a lot
 of pictures on this website. <br />There are pictures on every page.</li>
 
<li>This website doesn't respond super well to smaller windows. It is hard to 
see everything that is displayed when <br />you click on the browse button because the 
text overlaps other text.</li>

<li>I think that this website in general was very well done. It has a very nice 
look to it and the pictures were very <br />pretty and did not distract from the text.</li>
